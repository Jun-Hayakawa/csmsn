      <p class="download-text">Good work finding this. If you made it to this page you must be at least kinda interested in this project, so here's something for your effort. <br> <br>
                              This is the first song I made that I really felt proud of. It was in the middle of COVID and I was 17 years old. Listening to it now, it's 
                              definitely rough around the edges (and contains some pretty outdated memes lol), but it was the first song where I could identify
                              the beginnings of my own style, so its special to me. I'll probably never release this, so enjoy this secret track. <br> <br>
                              
                              Thanks again for listening =)
