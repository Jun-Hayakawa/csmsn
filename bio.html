          Q: WHO ARE YOU? <br>
A: I make music under the name Cesium-san, but my real name is Jun. I'm a 21 year old senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying electrical engineering, and this project is my hobby. When I'm not making music or studying, I like to stalk obscure message boards, code art pieces, and play co-op games with my friends. My three favorite things are old software, long walks, and soba. <br> <br>

Q: WHAT INSPIRES YOU? <br>
A: 20th century modernism / abandoned places / angelfire websites / ARGs / caustics / Chris Chan / compression artifacts / CRTs / drugs / eccojams / edutainment CD ROMs / feelings without words to describe them / flowers / fog / glacial troughs / goldsrc graphics / hikikomori / incels / James Ferraro / somniosidae / lore / malware / maximalism / minimalism / mysticism / my friends / obsession / places that reek of cigarette smoke / rabbit holes / rain / sea creatures / shrines / simulations / stillness / the internet / the moon and stars / the ocean / the sound of flourescent lights / utopian scholastic / White Noise by Don DeLillo / Windows XP <br> <br>

Q: WILL THERE BE MORE MUSIC? <br>
A: Yes, but idk when. I have plans for something more ambitious that should begin to coalesce this fall, so maybe I will put out some glimpses of that this year. It will take some time tho + I'm about to graduate from college and lots of life stuff will be going on. I'm also sitting on a lot of other songs recorded between '22 - '24 I'm debating whether or not I want to release. <br> <br>

Q: CAN I TALK TO YOU?<br>
A: Yes! I would love to hear feedback / comments / cryptic goblin riddles and you can email them to cesiumsan@outlook.com or dm me on whatever.<br> <br> <br> <br>

btw, thanks for listening =) <br> <br>
